# basic-file-exploit

## Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! Connect to the program with netcat: `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52682` The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/537/program-redacted.c).

## Getting Started

To start we'll connect to the server and download the source code.

### Connecting to the server

We run the netcat command given to us and are presented with 3 options:

```
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52682
Hi, welcome to my echo chamber!
Type '1' to enter a phrase into our database
Type '2' to echo a phrase in our database
Type '3' to exit the program
```
#### Option 1

Allows entry of data to the server:

```
1
1
Please enter your data:
test
test
Please enter the length of your data:
5
5
Your entry number is: 1
Write successful, would you like to do anything else?
```

#### Option 2

Allows our previously entered data to be read from the server:
```
2
2
Please enter the entry number of your data:
1
1
test
Read successful, would you like to do anything else?
```

#### Option 3

Allows us to exit from the program:
```
3
3

$
```

### Source code

Using wget we download the source code:

`wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/537/program-redacted.c`

We then open this in a text editor of our choice.

It's worth noting at this point I'm no developer. Although I ~~can~~ code it's primarily in bash and python as my day job is more to do with IaaS than developing applications. C is not a language I'm particularly familiar with so apologies to anyone knowlegeable in the language.

Initially we see several include statements, the import common c libraries that the application uses. We can see after this the flag variable is defined `static const char* flag = "[REDACTED]";`
